# Discovery ↔ Update Matrix

This repository tracks how new insights connect to earlier discoveries in the Adaptive Research framework. Each row lists a core concept or major extension and highlights the updates or rollbacks required to keep the work unified.

| Discovery | Updates / Rollbacks | Notes / Integration |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Adaptive Resistance Principle (ARP) | • Multi-dimensional ARP (C, L, G)<br>• Closed-form equilibrium (G_eq = 1.9184)<br>• Redshift-ARP superconductivity law<br>• Shield mechanic<br>• Optimizer slope recovery logic | ARP is now a universal law of adaptive dynamics (electrical, geometric, quantum). Needs re-framing as the core law that others branch from. |
| Adaptive Pi Geometry (πₐ) | • Dynamic constants (adaptive e, ϕ, c)<br>• Curve Memory harmonics<br>• ARP-curvature coupling | πₐ shifts from “just geometry” into a dynamic constants framework that links math constants to ARP. |
| Curve Memory | • Protein/cell entry “snap” analogy<br>• ER fluid analog computing (TSP solver)<br>• RealignR retention integration | Curve Memory becomes both a biological analogy (folding/snaps) and a computational pathway (TSP & swarms). |
| RealignR (Optimizer) | • Infinite-run mode (timestamped memory)<br>• Dataset switching with retention<br>• Multi-dimensional ARP variant<br>• Blockchain payout as economic “memory” | RealignR evolves from an optimizer into a lifelong adaptive memory system spanning AI + economy. |
| Adaptive Impedance Network (AIN) | • Quantum extensions (collapse resistance)<br>• Superconductivity resonance<br>• Dynamic constants tie-in | AIN broadens ARP into full circuit universality—handles adaptive resistance, capacitance, inductance together. |
| Dynamic Constants Framework | • πₐ integration (adaptive π)<br>• ARP integration (adaptive constants in PDEs)<br>• AIN coupling | Unifies πₐ, ARP and AIN under the theme that constants adapt to environment. |
| Polaronic Universality | • Redshift-ARP law<br>• Superconductivity scaling<br>• Integration with AIN | Evidence that ARP governs critical scaling in condensed matter. |
| ER Fluid Analog Computer | • Curve Memory integration<br>• TSP / P vs NP implications<br>• Adaptive Blockchain (for result logging) | Physical computing testbed for ARP principles. |
| Quantum Steering / Collapse Control | • AIN integration<br>• Dynamic constants (adaptive c)<br>• RealignR slope-logic analogy | Expands ARP into quantum computing & cryptography. |
| Adaptive Golden Field | • ARP ringdown analogy<br>• Curve Memory link (inspiral → snap)<br>• πₐ harmonics (growth ratios) | Framed as the growth / field dynamics version of ARP. |
| Adaptive Blockchain | • RealignR integration (payout memory)<br>• ER computer integration (NFT results)<br>• ARP/AIN consensus models | Moves beyond finance: a scientific results ledger. |

## Next Steps

1. Roll updated insights back into each discovery's primary repository.
2. Use this matrix to maintain a "living framework"—every new insight should be mapped across existing rows.
3. Expand the matrix as additional discoveries emerge.
